What is meant by "commenting out" code, and when might you want to do this?
	to add # so that python does not execute it
	used when you are trying to test/debug code, and only want a subset of your script to execute
What’s the difference between = and == in Python?
	= is to assign a variable, and == is to evaluate if left side equals right side
What does % do as an arithmetic operator in Python? Separately, how can you use % when you’re printing strings?
	divides, and returns the remainder of the division operation
	% is used in string formatting to do substitution - i.e. to print variable values as part of a print statement
What do %s, %r, and %d do in the context of string formatting?
	%s substitutes a string data value,
	%r substitutes a raw data value
	%d substitutes a digit data value
When you print a string that has \n in it, what happens?
	\n is interpreted as newline in the output
What’s the purpose of using triple quotes in Python (i.e., """)?
	to print multiple-line statement with a single print command
What would you have to do to get Python to print the following text: In Python, \n is used to print a new line ?
	escape out the backslash in the \n, i.e. \\n
When you’re doing string formatting, how can you force Python to print a specific number of decimal places? For instance, if you did x = 1.0/3.0 , and you want to print something that says One divided by three is roughly equal to 0.33, how can you get Python to format and substitute in your variable x without printing 12 decimal places?
	use round function to round it off to 2 decimal points  
	round(1.0/3.0,2)
Make sure you understand how indexing works with new string formatting -- for instance: print "My first name is {0} and my last name is {1}. You can call me {0}".format("John", "Doe").
Make sure you understand how named arguments work with new string formatting -- for instance: print "My first name is {first_name} and my last name is {last_name}. You can call me {first_name}".format(first_name = "Jane", last_name = "Doe").
Write a script that creates boolean, string, integer and floating point variables and prints out the data type and value of each variable.
	datatypes = {'mybool':True,'mystring':'steve','myint':10,'myfloat':3.14159}
	for datatype in datatypes:
		mytype=datatypes[datatype]
		print "%s type is %s" %(mytype, type(mytype).__name__)
If you were to summarize it in a sentence, what does None mean? Add a variable with value None to your script from question 11. What value and type does it output?
	None is python's equivalent to null and is what you would use to pass or return a null value to a variable or function.
	Null is of type NoneType - not boolean or other...

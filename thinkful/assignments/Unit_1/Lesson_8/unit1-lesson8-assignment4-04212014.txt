Unit 1 Lesson 8 Assignment 4
How do you open a file in Python in read only mode? How do you open a file in write mode?
	to read only, open(filename, 'r')
	to write, open(filename, 'w') ## this creates or overwrites
	or
			  open(filename, 'a+')  ## this creates or appends
			  
If you do f = open(‘myfile.txt’, ‘r’), will your variable f be a string?
	no it will be a file object
How do you read a file that you’ve opened?
	you can use the .read method or the .readlines method to return the entire file
	or you can use readline to return 1 line at a time
How do you write to a file object?
	use the write method to write to a file which has been opened with one of the write flags 
	fileobject.write("your text to be written")
	then close the fileobject to flush buffer and write to the file
Why is it critical that you explicitly close your files, especially when you’re writing to one?
	python doesnt write to the file at the time the command is executed, it writes to a buffer in memory.
		only writes to the file when you invoke the .close method
How can you use with and as to open a file and assign its contents to a variable, in order to avoid having to explicitly close the file object?
	with open("filename",w) as fh:  ## filehandle
		fh.write("my new text")		
What does it mean when we say that the data in a file object is buffered?
	written to memory in OS, not written to the file on disk yet
What does os.listdir() do?
	makes a call to the underlying OS filesystem and creates a list of all files in the specified directory
How can you use os.listdir() and os.path.join() together to iterate over and open files in a given directory?
			for filename in os.listdir(directory):
				file = os.path.join(directory,file)
				fh = open(file,'r')
				## do stuff with the file

Thinkful Unit 1
Lesson 4
Assignment 4


Do all the elements in a list need to be of the same type?
	no
What is the .append() method, and how do you use it?
	adds an object as the last element of an existing list
	listname.append(object)
How do you find the length of a list?
	len(listname)
Let’s say you have my_list = [1, 2, "three", 4]. If you wanted to reassign the third element to be 3 (as an integer, not string), how could you do this?
	my_list[2] = 3
Let’s say you have my_list = [1, 2, "three", "five", 6]. What method could you use to assign the value 4 to come between "three" and "five" in my_list?
	my_list.insert(3,4)
How can you sort a list?
	list.sort() ## replaces existing list
	newlist=sorted(list)  ## creates new sorted list
Given my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], what would the following slices return?
my_list[:]
	all elements, in current order
	[1,2,3,4,5,6]
my_list[0:]
	all elements, starting with element with index 0
	[1,2,3,4,5,6]
my_list[3:]
	all elements from index 3 to end of list
	[4,5,6]
my_list[:3]
	all elements from beginning to list to 3-1 index
	[1,2,3]
my_list[1:3]
	elements with index # 1,2
	[2,3]
Working with the same my_list from question 7, what do you think my_list[-1] and my_list[-3] would give you? Come up with a theory about this, and then try it out from the command line or on repl.it.
	-1 is the last element in the list, (or the 1st element if you are working your way backwards
	[6]
	-3 is the 3rd element from the end
	[4]

How can you test to see whether or not a given value appears in a given list?
	if value in list
How would you go about printing out each item in a list on its own line?
	for i in list:
		print i
